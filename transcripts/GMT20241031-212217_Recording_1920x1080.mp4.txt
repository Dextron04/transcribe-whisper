Motion passes. Okay. Moving on to the approval. Oh, there's no approval minutes. Okay. Moving on to open forum. Is there any member of the public that wishes to address the committee? Okay. Moving on to discussion item a, policy agenda discussion with Alexander Derson. Correct me if I'm wrong from saying that I'm so sorry, but welcome Alexander. Thank you so much for being here. We appreciate your time here with us. And going over our policy agenda. If you want to go ahead and either kind of introduce yourself and kind of get started, or we can just also I can go over the policy agenda, whatever you'd like. Yeah. Hi, everyone. Alexander Derson. I'm here in the office of the president. I'm here as the government community relations liaison and here to talk with you all about the policy agenda. And I would just love to hear more about what you have on this agenda or if it's still in the works. And maybe provide some insight. And yeah, looking forward to it. Thank you so much. So we have been working on our policy agenda since the beginning of semester, just kind of going through a rough outline of what we wanted to make our goals for the policy agenda. When we kind of wanted to push it out to the students. And then now we're just kind of getting more involved with specifically breaking up those pillars up in different. Again, the goals right now we have. Can we also pull that up? I'm so sorry. You know. The policy agenda working dog. If not, it's okay. Sorry, it gives like 30 seconds. But right now we kind of have our goals for it is talking about basic needs, health care, mental health on campus, all of those things how we can improve that. We have our campus and public safety standards that we want to talk about, including safe walk, you know, kind of working with you PD more. And then we also have. A board of all housing on campus housing future collaborations props. We're working really really well with. We got past. We got our props that we wanted to pass that our board is going to support last a couple of weeks ago. And now we're just kind of seeing how we want to incorporate it. Those specific props into our policy agenda. If they can fit. And our new ones we did come up with of these pillars that we're also going to add into the policy agenda is the parking tax, which is really important on campus. Historically, it's always been something that is advocated for. And then lastly, we have the infrastructure for accessibility and student safety, which would be with like prop B. If it does get past or if it doesn't either one we want to kind of advocate for that. So just like ramps elevators. ADA accessibility and things like that. So that's what we have so far if it's on the screen. Yes. We just kind of talked about updates. We're just kind of in a research and really rough draft stage right now. We don't have concrete. I don't know like details and things were all just kind of discussing each meeting last meeting we did talk about the props that we could integrate into this. So as you can see here in each column we tried our best to kind of see what proper to work best in each category and things like that. So yeah, that's where we're at right now. And I think for you, it would just kind of be helping us out if you see or know anything on this agenda. So what resources would be best that we can go to for more information if we have any questions, things like that. Yeah, this is great. Can you scroll down as they're more to this agenda. Okay, great. So I love it. I would say that this obviously will eventually take place in a more agenda looking document, but this is a great planning document. So the main thing to when I'm thinking of developing a policy agenda start with your core values. And that should be the first section of your agenda. So talk about that as a group. And then from there there should be three to four major priorities. And then from the parking tax, that wouldn't necessarily be a priority. That would be a goal. So I'll put like an example in the chat of like what developing an agenda, a policy agenda might look like I hope that everyone can view that. And then start with your priorities. Oh, there we go. You have it. So like an example might be like student health and wellness and might be basic needs. It might be workforce development. You can word it a little bit longer, do a short heading, whatever you want to do. Provide some context there about why it's important. Then from there underneath, you're going to have like two to three or I would say one to three goals. What are you going to accomplish. So the goal would be we want to lower the parking tax for students. And then underneath that is the ask you don't have to include the asks in any documents to the student body. I would say that you can save those for legislators. And those ask are like, what are we going to ask our legislators to do or our allies or whatever it is to make these goals happen. So that's the way I like to structure it. I like to think in threes. So if you can develop like three to four major priorities. Underneath that, you can file in all your goals based on that in terms of including the props. We're voting on those in four days. So saying like supporting, you know, prop B. By the time this document is ready to go for students. Obviously, that will be passed by now. But you can take those same like values and goals within each of those props. And we've that into what your priorities are. But I love the way that you had structured. If you could hold the other the planning doc back up for a second. Yeah, so like affordable housing. That's a great priority. And then underneath that, what would be your biggest goals. And you can talk to students about that. Talk to the housing staff. Do research into what others CSU campuses or, you know, other states, other, the UC system, how they are creating affordable housing for their students. And that can inform what your goals are. And then, you know, in those asks that you have, you can use examples of what other, oh, yeah, you compare with other CSU housing policies. You already have that in there. Good. That's great. Yeah. So that's a great way to communicate what your goals and ask are based on what other similar institutions are doing. But I think this is great. I think that once you have your your core policy priorities and your core values down and you file everything in, you can create this really streamlined document that can showcase what it is that you're all trying to get done because this will serve as the blueprint for what your advocacy isn't what your goals are. Are there any specific questions that anyone has about this. Thank you, Alexander. I appreciate that. Is it okay if we keep that example that you dropped in the chat. Yeah, please do whatever you want with that. And you know, there's more than one way to create a policy agenda. This is just one example. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. Does anybody else have questions. So I have met Alex before this meeting. So I go on my plan for public safety and how should I advocate for that. Thank you to him for that. But I don't have any questions right now. Great. Good to see you. No, I can't see you on the screen right now, but I hear you. How would you kind of help us then when you talk about the core values that we should kind of start off with. I think what you're saying is also like we have too many kind of categories in in our kind of draft right now. Is that correct or am I. I think maybe it's not too many, but yeah, like parking tax. That's not really a whole priority. That's one goal that would be underneath the priority. So if you were able to based on you can look at all the props you supported as inspiration. What are the big themes. So for our office for 2025 we selected workforce development in economic development. Basic needs and college access readiness and completion. So those are like the big umbrellas. And those are our major priorities. It could be like addressing the tuition price. If that's something that your administration is concerned about, it could be like support for mental health services. Those are like the big priorities and those are going to be rooted in what your core values are. And then underneath that you're going to have the goals that you're going to try to accomplish. And then underneath that is the specific things that you're going to ask of people in order to get those goals accomplished. So it's kind of like a like a tiered cake with the big priorities as the base layer of the cake. And then the top is going to be the specific asks that you're going to ask people to do to make these awesome goals a reality. But everything you have in this document is really great. And this is totally going to inform what your final policy agenda is. Yeah, thank you. Okay, I see I see what you're saying now. So we just kind of have to concise it a little bit more and make it. Yeah, in figure out. So when you're, let's say you are going to be meeting with Matt Haney, he's going to want to know like what are the main things that you care about those are going to be like your three to four priorities. So you're going to say like, hey, we're really concerned with affordable housing. There's that synergy there. So that's like the big kind of like headline umbrella that rules them in underneath that. What are you actually trying to accomplish? So parking tax that might fall underneath like affordability for students or like addressing the high cost of living in San Francisco. That could be the priority. And then affordable housing parking tax reduction. Those are all the goals underneath that. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Just to make it more a little bit more realistic of what we can accomplish as well. I think would make more sense. Yeah, and just like a more streamlined, I need to use that word before way to analyze it and having those four priorities down is going to be the way that you can market what your administration is trying to accomplish and kind of serve as that like the blueprint of like here is what we're doing in our actions as a group are going to fall. Underneath these different priorities. Yeah. But it looks like you all have done some really great work in here. And yeah, like filing those props underneath there using, you know, the term prop G is going to kind of lose meaning pretty quickly once the selections over, but the values and the things that prop G is going to be addressing underneath that that is evergreen and you can still use those to frame your goals and your asks. Any other questions from anyone? All right. Well, thank you, Alexander. I really appreciate you being here and talking to us. Definitely still going to use you as a resource because please. Yeah, please. I'm going thing for a while. I'm going to email you back, Andrea, about getting coffee or lunch. Oh, yes, yes. I haven't forgotten about you. Don't worry. I told you get it. You're fine. Thank you so much for remembering. Well, I don't know if you all want me to stay for the remainder of the meeting or if I've fulfilled. I think that was really it. I think we kind of need to go forward and kind of talk about what it is that we're going to divide it up now with that with what you said. And then in the future, we can always ask you back for another meeting if possible. Absolutely. I'd love to come back whenever you need me and feel free to email whenever anyone has any questions or if you want to set up a meeting with someone or anything like that and all. Be a resource to help you out in any way I can. Perfect. Thank you, Alexander again. I really appreciate you taking the time. And if nobody else has any further questions, then we can move on. All right. Well, great to see you all and keep on kicking out of all of you. This is a great. Some great values and this is a great agenda they're working on and I can't wait to see it evolve and end up in this final beautiful agenda. I'll catch you all later. Happy Halloween. Thanks. Take care. Okay. How do we feel now? Do we feel like a little bit clear about this whole thing? Yeah, I think it definitely required some like needed items on how to like approach this. Great. Do we want to get into this right now or do should we say this for our next meeting? I was going to end it here with another announcement about tabling. But if we wanted to go into this and like work a little bit on it and restructure it, we can also do that. It's not in discussion. Or it is, we're so in discussion. I think that like Alexander gave us some great like idea. So maybe we can take those and like just think about them for the next two weeks and then come back with like, you know, all of our input and be like ready to go. But I don't have everyone else. I think it's so good. I think that we can think more about it and then we can come here to go to them. Yeah. Okay. Cool. And then we can also see how it's going to work out with the election. What gets not how we can kind of integrate whatever gets past or what doesn't and go from there to make more specific goals. Instead of kind of just saying, oh, yeah, this would work here. This would not work here. Is that sound good? Okay. Cool. And then did everyone get my email about the tabling. I know I'll see in Karina. Is there any update with the tabling like exact time and dates or no? Yeah. So it took a while to hear back from them. But I finally got the TPM exemption approved and then the tabling request form approved and y'all are able to table today, tomorrow and Monday. Okay. Cool. I will then send an email to the board today. If you Karina, do you mind sending me just like the details about it so I can write in an email to everyone? Yeah. Of course. I'll forward all of the approvals to you as well. Okay. Thank you. And then you guys might ask is that you just please go out and table try to get as many people out there engaging at the table. And then I will try to get as well as you to encourage your fellow board members to get out there and table with you and kind of support external affairs as well as voting because this is very important election on Tuesday. So yes, I will send it another email and then if there's no further questions on that, I will go ahead and conclude our discussion. Anybody else? I'll be tabling tomorrow from 12 to 2. But if anyone else is able to like table with me during that time or before that time, then be great because I can only do those two hours tomorrow, but we can get people at different hours that we even better. Yeah. No. I can be there on Monday to table with you. So. Yeah. It's on Monday. Physically. Yeah. I'm so excited. Anyways, yes, I'll send that information again. If you have any questions, you can always email me Christine or Karina. Other than that, I now conclude our discussion item. There are no action items and then. Any other further announcements that anyone has. Yeah, I have one. So. I'll send it for the all kind of so I was in. I've been made thanks to Karina for helping you with that. And the resources of the overall, I mean, really posting on the ass is. They said on Monday, you'll be out. Okay. Cool. Thank you for that. Thank you for that. Thank you for that. Thank you. Does anybody else have an announcement? Okay. Seeing no further announcements. I adjourn this meeting at. 256 PM. I hope you all have a good Halloween and I will see you on Monday or Tuesday. Next week, everyone. Take care. Bye. Bye.
